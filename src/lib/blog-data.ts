      <p class="lead">Everyone loves a good deal, especially when it comes to flights. With a few smart strategies, you can significantly reduce your travel costs and have more to spend on your actual trip. Here are our top tips for finding the best flight deals in 2025.</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">1. Be Flexible with Your Travel Dates</h3>
      <p>Flight prices can vary dramatically depending on the day of the week, time of year, and holidays. If you can be flexible, try searching for flights during the middle of the week (Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often cheapest) and avoid peak travel seasons.</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">2. Use Flight Comparison Websites</h3>
      <p>Websites like Google Flights, Skyscanner, and Momondo are powerful tools for comparing prices across multiple airlines. Use their features to set up price alerts for your desired route, so you get notified when the price drops.</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">3. Book in Advance (But Not Too Far)</h3>
      <p>There's a sweet spot for booking flights. For international travel, aim to book 2-3 months in advance. Booking too early or too late can often result in higher prices. For domestic flights, 1-2 months is usually ideal.</p>

      <p class="mt-6">Finding a great flight deal is the first step to an amazing vacation. Let Tembo Tours handle the search for you, ensuring you get the best value without the hassle.</p>

      <p class="lead">Embarking on your first safari is a thrilling experience, but it can also be a bit overwhelming to plan. What should you pack? When is the best time to go? This guide will help you prepare for the adventure of a lifetime in the heart of the African wilderness.</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">What to Pack for Your Safari</h3>
      <p>Packing correctly is crucial for a comfortable and safe safari. Opt for neutral-colored clothing (khaki, olive, brown) to blend in with the environment. Lightweight layers are key, as temperatures can vary significantly from early morning game drives to midday heat. Don't forget essentials like a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, insect repellent, and a good pair of binoculars.</p>

      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">Choosing Your Destination and Timing</h3>
      <p>East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, is world-renowned for its incredible wildlife viewing. The best time to visit is during the dry seasons (June to October and January to February) when animals congregate around water sources, making them easier to spot. This is also when the Great Migration typically passes through the Maasai Mara.</p>
      
      <h3 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">Safari Etiquette</h3>
      <p>Respecting wildlife is paramount. Always listen to your guide, never get out of the vehicle without permission, and keep your voice low to avoid startling the animals. Remember, you are a guest in their home. Patience is key; sometimes the most rewarding sightings come after a quiet wait.</p>

      <p class="mt-6">A safari is more than just a vacation; it's an opportunity to connect with nature on a profound level. Let Tembo Tours craft your perfect safari itinerary, from luxury lodges to expert-guided game drives. Contact us to start planning your adventure.</p>
